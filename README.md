# Planet_Trajectory
Here's a little project I did for fun. In this project, I will be simulating the trajectory of a planet around its star under Newtonian Gravity. I will use modules like NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib.pyplot to solve the equations of motion and plot the trajectory, distance, angular momentum per unit mass, and energy per unit mass. I will use the DOP853 method, a higher order Runge-Kutta method, for accuracy and show how it contrasts with when we do not use it. Lastly, as we will see later, I will talk a little about why this method fails to conserve energy while it perfectly conserves angular momentum.
