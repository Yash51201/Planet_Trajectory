The equation of motion for the position vector $\vec{r}(t) = (x(t), y(t))$: $$\ddot{\vec{r}} = -\frac{GM}{|\vec{r}|^3}\vec{r}$$

where $G$ is the Universal Gravitational Constant, $M$ is the mass of the star, and $\vec{r}$ is the position vector.

The second order ODE can be further simplified as a system of first order ODEs: $$\dot{x} = v_x,\space \dot{y} = v_y,\space \dot{v_x} = -\frac{GM}{|\vec{r}|^3}x,\space \dot{v_y} = -\frac{GM}{|\vec{r}|^3}y$$
