For convenience of calculation, I will be taking $GM \approx 4\pi^2 AU^3/yr^2$, which transforms the acceleration terms as: 

$$\dot{v}_{(x, y)} = -\frac{4\pi^2}{|\vec{r}|^3}(x, y)$$

I will define the following initial values for postion: 

$$x(0) = 1\space AU,\space y(0) = 0$$

At aphelion, the vis-viva equation simplifies to: 

$$v = \sqrt{GM\frac{(1-e)}{a(1+e)}}$$

For an $a = 1$ AU and eccentricity $e = 0.3$, the velocity at perihelion is: 

$$v \approx 0.73*2\pi$$

I will assume that the velocity is only in the y-direction at `t = 0`. So the initial values for velocity are: 

$$v_x(0) = 0,\space v_y(0) = 0.73*2\pi$$
